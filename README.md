# plant_supplementary
This repository contains the networks/ and data/ necessary to generate the results in the paper quickly. It's separate from [plant](https://github.com/wangpatrick57/plant) because it is rather large (about 900MB as of the time of writing)
Edit the path in ```set_up.sh``` and then run it to set the environment variables PLANT_DATA_DIR and PLANT_NETWORKS_DIR so that the scripts in [plant](https://github.com/wangpatrick57/plant) can point to these directories
